========================

.. _terms-Python:

      Depicts how a concept works. Illustration (illo) may be a Figure (image or SVG file); a Table; or, a Graph (directed acyclic graph).

.. _terms-Parser:

   Parser
      Deposition service that reads food record from GS1 data stream. Using a lexical analyzer and regular expression, parser matches tokens from data stream to ontology terms. Parser output is used to update graphs and build a new application instance for quality assurance.

.. _terms-OnTop:

   OnTop
      Deposition service to parse inputs and generate outputs.

.. _terms-Landing-Page:

   Landing Page

   Listing Page
      Displays items that share facets and predicates.

   Depositor
      Food supplier that submits information about food items to label project.

.. _terms-Navigation:

   Navigation
      Map applications, such as Google Maps, display points-of-interest when a user selects and navigates different routes to a destination. For label project, landscape is represented as graphs (rather than maps) and a user navigates facets and predicates to display foods-of-interest.
