Grammar
   Rules for specifying a set of well-formed structures using Terms of a given Language.

Language
   Set of Terms specified by a Syntax and sequenced according to a Grammar. Language is used to systematically define and aggregate knowledge.

Ontology
   Combination of the above to express higher order activities, such as communications, translation, learning, understanding, teaching, and making decisions. More specifically, a formal way to represent entities, ideas, and events (Things). Things have Properties such as names and values. Things have Relations such as kinship and sequence of steps (ordinality) to perform a task. Things, Properties and Relations are organized by categories (Taxonomy). Knowledge - in a form that can be processed by a computer - is the categorical ordering of Things, Properties and Relations from Domain-of-Context into a Domain-of-Knowledge.
